# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I approached with a hybrid theory. Can't fully say what it's a blend of.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Youtube tutorials, and stackoverflow.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 11 originally? The Jsonconfig file cost additional hours, along with using git. 


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 5?


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The program refuesed to compile properly due to the jsonconfile. Also, git was not working proplery after hours of troubleshooting.
